# 👋 Hey there! 
I've just created a new repo on GitHub called "Power BI Notebook". 🚀

In this repo, I'm going to create different branches that focus on the usage and various applications of Power BI. From creating beautiful visualizations to exploring its features, this repo will be a hub for all things Power BI. 💻

Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to contribute to the repo. Let's explore the world of Power BI together! 🤝
